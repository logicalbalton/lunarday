        <h2>Lunar Day</h2>
        <p>A lunar day is the period it takes for the Moon to complete one rotation on its axis and one orbit around the Earth, which is about 29.5 Earth days. This results in the same side of the Moon always facing Earth, a phenomenon known as synchronous rotation. The phases of the Moon, from new moon to full moon, are visible during this period.</p>

        <h2>Chandrayaan 1</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Aim:</strong> To conduct high-resolution remote sensing of the lunar surface, particularly the permanently shadowed regions near the poles.</li>
            <li><strong>Launch Date:</strong> October 22, 2008</li>
            <li><strong>Description & Objective:</strong> Chandrayaan-1 was India's first lunar probe under the Chandrayaan program. The mission aimed to survey the lunar surface to produce a detailed chemical and mineralogical map and study the Moon's topography. It detected water/hydroxyl on the Moon and confirmed the presence of water ice in the lunar soil.</li>
            <li><strong>Rocket Name:</strong> PSLV-XL C11 (Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle)</li>
            <li><strong>Cost:</strong> Approximately $54 million</li>

        <h2>Chandrayaan 2</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Aim:</strong> To explore the south polar region of the Moon, particularly to search for water ice and conduct surface and sub-surface scientific studies.</li>
            <li><strong>Launch Date:</strong> July 22, 2019</li>
            <li><strong>Description & Objective:</strong> Chandrayaan-2 consisted of an orbiter, lander (Vikram), and rover (Pragyan). The mission's objectives included mapping the Moon's surface, studying its exosphere, and analyzing the south pole region's surface for water ice and other resources.</li>
            <li><strong>Rocket Name:</strong> GSLV Mk III-M1 (Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle)</li>
            <li><strong>Cost:</strong> Approximately $141 million</li>
            <li><strong>Fault:</strong> The Vikram lander lost communication during its descent to the lunar surface on September 6, 2019, and crash-landed due to a software issue that caused it to deviate from its intended trajectory and land at a higher speed than planned.</li>

        <h2>Chandrayaan 3</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Aim:</strong> To demonstrate a successful soft landing and roving capabilities on the lunar surface.</li>
            <li><strong>Launch Date:</strong> July 14, 2023</li>
            <li><strong>Description & Objective:</strong> Chandrayaan-3 consists of a lander and rover similar to Chandrayaan-2 but without an orbiter. The mission's objective is to achieve a soft landing on the Moon and deploy the rover to conduct in-situ scientific experiments, including analyzing the lunar soil and searching for water ice.</li>
            <li><strong>Rocket Name:</strong> LVM3 (Launch Vehicle Mark-3)</li>
            <li><strong>Cost:</strong> Approximately $75 million</li>

        <h2>Future Prospects</h2>
        <p>India's future plans and mission objectives for lunar day and projects to the Moon include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Lunar Polar Exploration (LUPEX) Mission:</strong> A joint mission with Japan's JAXA to explore the lunar south pole, focusing on water ice detection and utilization.</li>
            <li><strong>Mangalyaan 2:</strong> A follow-up Mars mission to study the Martian surface and atmosphere, building on the success of Mangalyaan 1.</li>
            <li><strong>Gaganyaan Mission:</strong> India's human spaceflight program aiming to send astronauts into space by 2024, marking a significant milestone in ISRO's capabilities.</li>
            <li><strong>Lunar Base Development:</strong> Long-term plans to establish a sustainable lunar base for scientific research and potential commercial activities.</li>
            <li><strong>International Collaboration:</strong> Continued collaboration with international space agencies for joint lunar and space exploration missions.</li>

        <h2>Moon Day</h2>
        <p>Mankind’s arrival on the only natural satellite available to the planet Earth took place, as mentioned above, on 20 July 1969.</p>
        <p>On that day, two of the Apollo 11 crew members, Neil Armstrong and Edwin “Buzz” Aldrin were, in that order, the first people to walk on the Moon. The third of the crew, Michael Collins, remained in orbit in the spacecraft, which is why he has even gone down in history as the “forgotten astronaut”.</p>
        <p>And if there is any idea or image that evokes the moon landing, it would undoubtedly be Armstrong’s phrase (“One small step for man, one giant leap for mankind”) or Aldrin’s footprint stamped on the lunar surface.</p>
        <p>This NASA mission was a turning point in the struggle between the United States and the Soviet Union in the space race, since the Eurasian country had already achieved numerous milestones such as the launch of the first living being into space (the dog Laika in 1957), the first human in space (Yuri Gagarin in 1961), the first woman in space (Valentina Tereshkova, in 1963) or the first space walk (led by Aleksei Leonov in 1965).</p>

        <h2>Chandrayaan 1</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Aim:</strong> To conduct high-resolution remote sensing of the lunar surface, particularly the permanently shadowed regions near the poles.</li>
            <li><strong>Launch Date:</strong> October 22, 2008</li>
            <li><strong>Description & Objective:</strong> Chandrayaan-1 was India's first lunar probe under the Chandrayaan program. The mission aimed to survey the lunar surface to produce a detailed chemical and mineralogical map and study the Moon's topography. It detected water/hydroxyl on the Moon and confirmed the presence of water ice in the lunar soil.</li>
            <li><strong>Rocket Name:</strong> PSLV-XL C11 (Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle)</li>
            <li><strong>Cost:</strong> Approximately $54 million</li>

        <h2>Chandrayaan 2</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Aim:</strong> To explore the south polar region of the Moon, particularly to search for water ice and conduct surface and sub-surface scientific studies.</li>
            <li><strong>Launch Date:</strong> July 22, 2019</li>
            <li><strong>Description & Objective:</strong> Chandrayaan-2 consisted of an orbiter, lander (Vikram), and rover (Pragyan). The mission's objectives included mapping the Moon's surface, studying its exosphere, and analyzing the south pole region's surface for water ice and other resources.</li>
            <li><strong>Rocket Name:</strong> GSLV Mk III-M1 (Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle)</li>
            <li><strong>Cost:</strong> Approximately $141 million</li>
            <li><strong>Fault:</strong> The Vikram lander lost communication during its descent to the lunar surface on September 6, 2019, and crash-landed due to a software issue that caused it to deviate from its intended trajectory and land at a higher speed than planned.</li>

            <li><strong>Launch Date:</strong> July 14, 2023</li>
            <li><strong>Description & Objective:</strong> Chandrayaan-3 consists of a lander and rover similar to Chandrayaan-2 but without an orbiter. 
                                                <p>The mission's objective is to achieve a soft landing on the Moon and deploy the rover to conduct in-situ scientific experiments, including analyzing the lunar soil and searching for water ice.</p></li>
